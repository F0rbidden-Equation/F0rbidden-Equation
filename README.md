- Welcome on the github F0rbidden-Equation

👨‍💻 Fullstack Dev turned Ethical Hacker
I build and deploy custom exploits, recon tools, and auditing scripts — blending code with curiosity to break, learn, and secure.

🛠️ Tech Stack: Python, Bash, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, SQL, PHP, Docker, Java, JSP, Servlet, Angular, Symfony, MVC
🔍 Domains: Web Pentesting, OSINT, CTFs, Vulnerability Research, Red Team Ops

🚧 Projects:
• Custom e-commerce platform (Java/JSP/MVC/MySQL) with XSS, SQLi, and RFI protections
• OSINT recon tool with Google Dorks, proxy rotation & web scraping (Python)
• Cybersecurity hardware projects: SDR (Software Defined Radio), RFID spoofing/cloning, Wi-Fi pentesting, robotics automation with Arduino & Raspberry Pi
• Admin dashboards with CRUD secured against common web vulns

Always building. Always learning. Always poking systems the right way.
